•	Project on App Analysis and Rating Prediction: Conducted comprehensive data analysis and visualization to identify key correlations between app features and ratings. Developed a predictive model using linear regression, achieving a mean R-squared of 0.6754, indicating strong predictive power. Implemented imputation and scaling techniques to enhance model performance and ensure data consistency.


•	SVM Model for Digit Recognition: Developed a highly accurate SVM model with a polynomial kernel, achieving a 98.61% cross-validated accuracy and 98.33% accuracy on the test set. Implemented PCA for dimensionality reduction, retaining significant variance while enhancing model efficiency and generalization.


•	Elbow Plot and KMeans Clustering for Optimal Cluster Identification: Implemented KMeans clustering, identified optimal clusters using the Elbow Method, and assigned instances to clusters. Achieved a 97.22% accuracy in digit classification using an SVM model with hyperparameters fine-tuned via grid search.
